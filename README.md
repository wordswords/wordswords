- 📫 How to reach me .. send an email to: 3rp2mzocr@mozmail.com.

In my professional life, I am attempting to pivot from my previous 20-year software career, in which I reached 'Principal Software Enginer' level, into a software-related Cyber Security role, such as red team, purple team, vuln discovery and security research. If you are in a position to help, offer advice, or mentor me in doing this, [please get in contact](3rp2mzocr@mozmail.com)!

I spend a lot of my spare time working on hobbyist technical projects to learn and build cool stuff for myself and my family, some of which are open-source.   My current main open-source 'hobby project' is vWorkbench, see: [https://davidcraddock.net/vworkbench/](https://davidcraddock.net/vworkbench/)
